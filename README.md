Event-Based Model
=================

The Event-Based Model (EBM) is a simple, robust model for the estimation of the most likely order of events in a degenerative disease.

This collection of code implements a basic/standard EBM, which is described in the papers listed below.

Installation occurs in a standard way, via the supplied setup.py file: ``python setup.py install``

Example usage can be found within the [examples](examples) folder.

Dependencies
============
The code depends heavily on NumPy, uses SciPy to calculate some stats and do some optimisation and uses Matplotlib just to do the plotting. See [requirements.txt](requirements.txt) for version details.

- [SciPy](https://github.com/scipy/scipy)
